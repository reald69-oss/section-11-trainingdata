## Conditional Fields

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Weather | Include if athlete location is available via profile or memory |
| Coach note (weather) | Include only if actionable (e.g., dress warm, indoor day) |
| Monotony | Include **only** if > 2.3. Omit entirely when normal |
| Durability | Include if qualifying sessions exist. Omit if 0 qualifying sessions in 7d |
| EF | Include if qualifying sessions exist. Omit if 0 qualifying sessions in 7d |
| TID 28d + drift | Include as separate line **only** if drift is "shifting" or "acute_depolarization". Omit entire line when "consistent" |
| Load/Recovery context | Include tolerance note only when within 0.2 of threshold |
| Next session | Include only on rest days |
| Modify/Skip rationale | Required when recommendation is not "Go" |

## Readiness Decision Logic

| Signal | Go | Modify | Skip |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| HRV | Within ±10% of 7d avg | ↓ 10-20% | ↓ >20% |
| RHR | At or below baseline | ↑ 3-4 bpm | ↑ ≥5 bpm |
| Sleep | ≥ 7h, quality 1-2 | 5-7h or quality 3 | < 5h or quality 4 |
| TSB | > -15 | -15 to -25 | < -25 |
| ACWR | 0.8–1.3 | 1.3–1.5 | > 1.5 |
| Feel | ≤ 3/5 | 4/5 | ≥ 4/5 + other flags |

> A single amber signal doesn't require modification. **Two or more amber signals** or **any red signal** should trigger Modify or Skip.

## Brevity Rule

- **Normal metrics, Go recommendation:** Keep interpretation to 2-3 sentences
- **Threshold breach or Modify/Skip:** Expand with specific reasoning
- **Rest day:** Brief — confirm recovery status, preview next session

## Formatting Rule

- **Durations and sleep:** Always use `_formatted` fields from JSON (e.g., `sleep_formatted`, `duration_formatted`, `total_training_formatted`). Never convert decimal `_hours` fields to display format — the formatted values are pre-calculated from raw seconds and avoid rounding errors.
