## Rounding Convention

Round zone percentages to the nearest **whole number** (1%). The JSON data source carries precise values for detailed analysis. A few seconds in a zone is noise, not signal — report `0%` not `0.1%`.

## Field Notes

| Field | When to include | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Distance | Cycling, running | Omit for SkiErg, strength |
| Power / Power zones | Activities with power data | Omit if no power meter |
| Grey Zone / Quality | Always for cycling | Highlights polarization compliance |
| Cadence | Cycling, running | Omit for SkiErg, strength |
| Decoupling | Sessions ≥ 1 hour | Key aerobic efficiency marker |
| EF | Activities with power + HR | Aerobic efficiency (NP ÷ HR); track trend over like-for-like sessions. Absolute value is individual-dependent |
| Variability Index | Cycling with power | 1.00–1.05 = steady, >1.05 = variable |
| Carbs used | Sessions with power data | Omit if unavailable |
| Durability (weekly) | Aggregate decoupling 7d/28d | Steady-state sessions only (VI ≤ 1.05, ≥ 90min). Trend direction matters more than absolute value |
| EF (weekly) | Aggregate EF 7d/28d | Steady-state cycling only (VI ≤ 1.05, ≥ 20min). Trend direction matters more than absolute value |
| TID 28d (weekly) | 28d Seiler classification + drift | Shows whether acute TID matches chronic pattern. Omit drift label when "consistent" |
| Weekly totals | Always | Running totals through current day |

## Assessment Labels

| Metric | Good | Watch | Flag |
|--------|------|-------|------|
| Decoupling | < 3% | 3–5% | > 5% |
| Variability Index | ≤ 1.05 | 1.05–1.10 | > 1.10 |
| ACWR | 0.8–1.3 | 1.3–1.5 | > 1.5 or < 0.8 |
| Grey Zone (Z3) | < 5% (base) | 5–10% | > 10% (base phase) |
| Durability (7d mean) | < 3% (good) | 3–5% (moderate) | > 5% (declining) |
| EF trend | improving/stable | — | declining |
| TID drift | consistent | shifting | acute_depolarization |
